### Hey there üôÇ

My name is Dani and I'm an engineer and musician currently based in Madrid, Spain. I'm a firm believer in free software (*as in freedom*), so most of my finished projects are open source.

I create a lot of different projects, as I enjoy learning and experimenting with technologies and ideas. You can find some of those projects here, but if you want to know more, you should check out my website where I talk about all the fun and interesting things I make and what I learn along the way. You'll also find my music and my thoughts on diverse topics.
